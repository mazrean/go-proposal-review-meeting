[GitHub has changed the way issue comments render, at least to me: now the issue title shows up when you type #nnn, not just the number. I've adjusted the minutes generator to avoid printing the issue title a second time, but I'm not planning to fix up all the old minutes. They'll just keep looking awful.]
