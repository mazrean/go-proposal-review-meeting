Since the Go 1.26 freeze is next Wednesday, November 26th, for the last few weeks the proposal review committee has been focusing on proposals that are both 1) priorities for 1.26, and 2) have a chance of being accepted before the freeze. In next week's review we'll wrap that up and shift our focus back to other active proposals that haven't been getting attention for the past few weeks.
