**2020-12-16 / @rsc, @griesemer, @ianlancetaylor, @bradfitz, @andybons, @spf13**

We will be taking the next two weeks off for the holidays
and will pick up with regular review meetings in 2021.
Happy end of year to all!

That said, because the two embed issues #43216 and #43217
and the reflect issue #40281 are blocking the release,
we plan to take a look at them over email next week and move
them along in the process if there is an established consensus.
We will post very short minutes if and when that happens.
