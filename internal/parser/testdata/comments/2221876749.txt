Due to an unfortunate confluence of events, the next proposal review meeting will not be until July 25. 
We missed July 3 due to the July 4th holiday in the US.
We missed July 10 due to GopherCon.
We will miss July 17 due to the scheduled Go quiet week.

Apologies for the relative silence. 
We're in the release freeze, so at least it's not holding up landing any work.
Hope you are all having a relaxing summer.
